\note{Suppose we want a more fine grained access to info, in a company, $\neq$ employees may be granted $\neq$ access to info, depending on how long they have been working for the company, etc. 

So for a given file $m$, $\neq$ employees will have access to $\neq$ info in $m$.

Say $m_1,m_2,m_3$ and $m_4$ are different parts of the info contained in $m$, and to which the yellow, blue, purple and red employees are respectively granted access. So the yellow employee is allowed to know $m_1$, the blue employee is allowed to know $m_2$ etc.

With traditional enc $\Rightarrow$ each employee must have his own pub and priv key pair,
\textbf{(click)}
 and the specific piece of information that a user is granted access to will be encrypted under his public key.
 
 But clearly this yields a lot of encryption keys, a lot of $\neq$ ciphertexts $\Rightarrow$ messy and heavyweight.
 Since all the info in $m_1,m_2,m_3$ and $m_4$ is actually contained in $m$,
 what we would like \textbf{(click)} is to have a single public key with which we encrypt the ciphertext, and thus a single ciphertext. But each employee possesses a $\neq$ decryption key which is associated to the part of info he is allowed to get about $m$.
 
 And so everyone gets the same ciphertext $C$, but depending on the secret key an employee owns, decryption recovers a different part of the information in $m$.
